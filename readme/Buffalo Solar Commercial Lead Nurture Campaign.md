Just a quick note — the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and NYSERDA commercial solar incentives are still active for qualifying projects, but they require installation timelines that can impact 2025 filings.

If you’ve been considering solar, this is a great time to revisit it. We can help you:
✅Determine eligibility for incentives
✅Compare cash vs. financed options
✅Review system designs and ROI projections

Get started today at www.buffalosolar.com or reply to this email and I’ll set up a brief review call.

Best regards,
